This topic describes how to upgrade Kubernetes clusters provisioned by <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>)
through the <%= vars.product_short %> Command Line Interface (PKS CLI).

For information about how to upgrade PKS-provisioned clusters
through the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile,<br>
see _Verify Errand Configuration_ in one of the following topics:

* [Upgrading Enterprise PKS](upgrade-pks.html)
* [Upgrading Enterprise PKS with NSX-T](upgrade-pks-nsxt.html)

For conceptual information about <%= vars.product_short %> upgrades,
see [About <%= vars.product_short %> Upgrades](understanding-upgrades.html).

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Upgrading a PKS-provisioned Kubernetes cluster updates
the <%= vars.product_short %> version and the Kubernetes version
of the cluster.
PKS-provisioned Kubernetes clusters upgrade when:

* You upgrade <%= vars.product_short %>
with the **Upgrade all clusters errand** enabled in the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile > **Errands**.
* You run `pks upgrade-cluster` or `pks upgrade-clusters`
as described in [Upgrade Clusters](#upgrade-clusters) below.

For example, running `pks upgrade-cluster`
upgrades the cluster you specify to your current version of <%= vars.product_short %>
and to the version of Kubernetes
that is included with your current version of <%= vars.product_short %>.

###<a id='prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

Before upgrading PKS-provisioned Kubernetes clusters through the PKS CLI:

* Install the PKS CLI.
For more information, see [Installing the PKS CLI](installing-pks-cli.html).
* Log in to <%= vars.product_short %> using `pks login`.
For more information, see [Logging in to <%= vars.product_short %>](login.html).

##<a id='upgrade-clusters'></a>Upgrade Clusters

You can upgrade individual or multiple 
clusters using the following procedures:

* [Upgrade a Single Kubernetes Cluster](#upgrade-cluster)  
* [Upgrade Multiple Kubernetes Clusters](#upgrade-clusters-multi)

To monitor or stop a cluster upgrade, follow the procedures in 
[Manage Your Kubernetes Cluster Upgrade Job](#manage-upgrade) below.

###<a id='upgrade-cluster'></a>Upgrade a Single Cluster

The <%= vars.product_short %> CLI provides `upgrade-cluster` for upgrading an individual <%= vars.product_tile %>-provisioned 
Kubernetes cluster. 

To upgrade an individual Kubernetes cluster, 
run the following command:

```
pks upgrade-cluster CLUSTER-NAME
```
Where `CLUSTER-NAME` is the name of the Kubernetes cluster you want to upgrade.

To upgrade multiple clusters, see [Upgrade Multiple Kubernetes Clusters](#upgrade-clusters-multi) below.  

For more information about the `pks upgrade-cluster` command, see [pks upgrade-cluster](cli/index.html#upgrade-cluster) in the _PKS CLI_ documentation.    

###<a id='upgrade-clusters-multi'></a>Upgrade Multiple Clusters

The <%= vars.product_short %> CLI provides `upgrade-clusters` for upgrading multiple <%= vars.product_tile %>-provisioned 
Kubernetes clusters. 
You can upgrade clusters serially, serially with some clusters designated as canary clusters, or entirely in parallel.  

To upgrade a single cluster, see [Upgrade a Single Kubernetes Cluster](#upgrade-cluster) above.

For more information about the `pks upgrade-clusters` command, see [pks upgrade-clusters](cli/index.html#upgrade-clusters) in the _PKS CLI_ documentation.    

####<a id='upgrade-clusters-parallel'></a> Upgrade Clusters in Parallel

To upgrade multiple Kubernetes clusters, run the following command:

```
pks upgrade-clusters --clusters CLUSTER-NAMES --max-in-flight CLUSTER-COUNT --wait
```
Where:

* `CLUSTER-NAMES` is a comma-delimited list of the names of the Kubernetes clusters you want to upgrade. 

* `CLUSTER-COUNT` is the maximum number of clusters to upgrade in parallel within an an AZ.  
    * If the `CLUSTER-NAMES` list is longer than the `CLUSTER-COUNT`, the first set of clusters are upgraded in parallel and
    subsequent clusters are queued and then upgraded in parallel as the preceding cluster upgrades complete.  
    * If an upgrade fails for a cluster in the `CLUSTER-NAMES` list, the job continues to a subsequent cluster in the list.  
    * To run the cluster upgrade job as a background task, remove the `--wait` argument.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Run <code>upgrade-clusters</code> with a <code>--max-in-flight</code> 
      argument less than your BOSH Director > Director Config > <strong>Director Workers</strong> value. 
      For example, if your <strong>Director Workers</strong> value remains the default of <code>5</code>, 
      run <code>upgrade-clusters</code> with a <code>--max-in-flight</code> argument value less than <code>5</code>.
    </p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>max-in-flight</code> is an optional argument. 
      If <code>max-in-flight</code> is not set, <%= vars.product_short %> uses the default 
      <code>max-in-flight</code> value of <code>1</code> and the clusters are upgraded serially.
    </p>

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pks upgrade-clusters --clusters k8-cluster-000,k8-cluster-001,k8-cluster-002 --max-in-flight 2  --wait
<br>
You are about to upgrade k8-cluster-000, k8-cluster-001 and k8-cluster-002.
Warning: This operation may be long running and may block further operations on the cluster(s) until complete
<br>
Continue? (y/n):y
Your taskID for the upgrade task is: d772aba0-2670-4fba-b26c-044b19d6ab60
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-000
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-001
Finished upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-000
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-002
Finished upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-001
Finished upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-002
Upgrade task d772aba0-2670-4fba-b26c-044b19d6ab60 is done.
</pre>

####<a id='upgrade-clusters-errors'></a> Upgrade Clusters With Canaries

To upgrade multiple clusters and automatically stop upgrading clusters if a cluster upgrade fails, 
specify your cluster list as canary clusters. 
You can specify one or more clusters as canary clusters.  

To upgrade multiple clusters with one or more canary clusters, run the following command:

```
pks upgrade-clusters --canaries CANARY-CLUSTER-NAMES --clusters CLUSTER-NAMES --wait
```
Where:

* `CANARY-CLUSTER-NAMES` is a comma-delimited list of the names of the Kubernetes clusters you want to upgrade as canary clusters. 

* `CLUSTER-NAMES` is a comma-delimited list of Kubernetes clusters to upgrade if all canary clusters successfully upgrade.
    * The specified canary clusters are upgraded prior to upgrading the clusters in your `CLUSTER-NAMES` list.  
    * Canary clusters are always upgraded serially.
    * If an upgrade fails for a canary cluster, the entire `upgrade-clusters` job stops. 
    * If an upgrade fails for a cluster in the `CLUSTER-NAMES` list, the `upgrade-clusters` job continues to a subsequent cluster in the list.  
    * To run the cluster upgrade job as a background task, remove the `--wait` argument.  

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>--clusters</code> is a required argument. 
    To configure <code>upgrade-clusters</code> to stop for any cluster upgrade failure, 
    specify only one cluster in your <code>CLUSTER-NAMES</code> list and 
    the remaining clusters in your <code>CANARY-CLUSTER-NAMES</code> list.
    </p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Canary clusters are always upgraded serially. 
      Only the clusters specified in the <code>--clusters</code> list are upgraded in parallel 
      when you run <code>upgrade-clusters</code> with both <code>--canaries</code> and 
      <code>--max-in-flight</code> arguments.
    </p>

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ pks upgrade-clusters --canaries k8-cluster-dev,k8-cluster-000,k8-cluster-001  --clusters k8-cluster-002  --wait
<br>
You are about to upgrade k8-cluster-dev k8-cluster-000, k8-cluster-001 and k8-cluster-002.
Warning: This operation may be long running and may block further operations on the cluster(s) until complete

Continue? (y/n):y
Your taskID for the upgrade task is: ce31a1bb-380a-453f-afa0-835ffa1ce6ac
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-000
Upgrading cluster succeeded: k8-cluster-000
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-001
Upgrading cluster succeeded: k8-cluster-001
Started upgrading cluster: k8-cluster-dev
Upgrading cluster failed: k8-cluster-dev
Upgrade task ce31a1bb-380a-453f-afa0-835ffa1ce6ac is done.

###<a id='stop-upgrade-job'></a> Stop Your Cluster Upgrade Job

To cancel a running `upgrade-clusters` job, run the following PKS CLI command:

```
pks cancel-task TASKID
```
Where `TASKID` is the ID of the task that was returned when you ran `pks upgrade-clusters`.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> <code>pks cancel-task</code> does not cancel cluster upgrades currently in progress. This command only cancels a job's pending cluster upgrades.
