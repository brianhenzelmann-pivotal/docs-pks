<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <%= vars.product_short %> Management Console 1.8 is not available for download yet.</p>

You can deploy a new <%= vars.product_full %> instance on vSphere either by using the VMware <%= vars.product_short %> Management Portal configuration wizard to guide you through the configuration process, or by importing an existing YAML configuration file into the YAML editor.

- [Deploy Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition by Importing a YAML Configuration File](console-deploy-yaml.html)

If you deploy <%= vars.product_short %> with plans that use Windows worker nodes, further configuration is required. See <a href="console-windows-workers.html">Enable Plans with Windows Worker Nodes</a> for information about how to install a Windows Server stemcell and other necessary configuration actions that you must perform after you deploy <%= vars.product_short %>.
